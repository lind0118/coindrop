# üêñ Coindrop üí∞

A shareable landing page for one-time payments and donations

## Motivation

Senders and receivers of money need to agree on medium of exchange. With so many apps and cryptocurrencies available to perform this service, it is not trivial to come to an agreement on which payment method to use. Often, receivers will list a single form of payment, but the potential sender does not have access to this form of payment, or it is not convenient for them. This causes unnecessary friction and potential abandonment of the transaction in the case of donations.

## Solution

Coindrop allows the receiver to list *all* their available forms of payment, and the sender to choose which one to use according to their preference (typically to maximize convenience and minimize transaction fees).

Receivers create a Coindrop address e.g. coindrop.to/satoshi-nakamoto and publish/share their Coindrop address anywhere as a substitute for publishing a single payment address or multiple addresses individually. For example, by replacing a user's CashApp $cashtag in their Twitter profile with their Coindrop address, they can reap the benefits of all possible payment methods with the same simplicity.

## Limitations

The use of Coindrop does not exclude the user from any legal requirements regarding payment acceptance. Users are responsible for understanding all applicable laws from their jurisdictions and ensuring they are being used according to the law.

## Principles

The Coindrop project is built according to the following principles:
