# Coindrop 🐖💰

Create your shareable list of addresses for peer-to-peer payments

## Problem ❓

Senders and receivers of money need to agree on medium of exchange. With so many apps and cryptocurrencies available to perform this service, it is not trivial to find the best payment method to use.

Often, receivers will list a single form of payment, but the potential sender does not have access to this form of payment, or it is not convenient for them. This causes unnecessary friction and potential abandonment of the transaction. 

## Solution ✔️

Coindrop allows the receiver to list all their available forms of payment, and the sender can choose which to use according to their preference (typically in order to maximize convenience and minimize transaction fees).

Receivers create a Coindrop address e.g. [coindrop\.to/satoshi](https://coindrop.to/satoshi) and publish/send the link as a substitute any time they would normally publish/send payment address(es) individually.

### When/where to use it? 🕒

* Does someone owe you money? ✔️ Send them your Coindrop link
* Would you like to accept donations? ✔️ Create a Coindrop for your brand and share it on your website or social media profile
* Do you provide services to customers in the real world and want to receive tips? ✔️ Add your Coindrop link to your business card
