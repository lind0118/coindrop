# Coindrop 🐖

A shareable landing page for peer-to-peer payments

## Motivation ❓

Senders and receivers of money need to agree on medium of exchange. With so many apps and cryptocurrencies available to perform this service, it is not trivial to find the best payment method to use. Often, receivers will list a single form of payment, but the potential sender does not have access to this form of payment, or it is not convenient for them. This causes unnecessary friction and potential abandonment of the transaction in the case of donations.

## Solution ✔️

Coindrop allows the receiver to list *all* their available forms of payment, and the sender to choose which one to use according to their preference (typically to maximize convenience and minimize transaction fees).

Receivers create a Coindrop address e.g. <coindrop.to/satoshi-nakamoto> and publish/share their Coindrop address anywhere as a substitute for publishing a single payment address or multiple addresses individually. For example, by replacing a user's CashApp $cashtag in their Twitter profile with their Coindrop address, they can reap the benefits of all possible payment methods with the same simplicity.

## Principles 🙏🏻

The Coindrop project is built according to the following principles:

### Transparency 👀
